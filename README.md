# fastr-examples

Experimenting with Clojure-FastR interop.

## Intro

This repo offers some examples of using GraalVM's [FastR](https://github.com/oracle/fastr) from Clojure.

The idea is to have a proof of concept.

These days we are working on a general R-interop library, that is planned to target different R runtimes: GNU-R, Renjin, FastR. The experiments here are a proof of concept to supoprt that work.

## Usage

Make sure you have a working version of GraalVM with FastR -- details [here](https://github.com/oracle/fastr#getting-started).

Run this Clojure project where your default JVM is set to GraalVM. [TODO: Link to instructions].

Open a REPL with `lein repl` (or through your favourite editor), and play with the [examples](./examples).
